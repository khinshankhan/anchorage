* The Sitch
  I've also been discontent with my website and I must've changed it 10+ times now. This time I'm going to make it with
  modern technology and aim for a synergetic digital Hopefully this is the last time.

  Naming it =anchorage= to keep me anchoredâ€¦ hopefully :blush:.

* Disclaimer
  I might make this a reusable gatsby template in the future, but it's a burden right now while developing and it'd be a
  bit much to maintain it immediately.

  That said, feel free to contribute and help keep this clean and generalized enough to easily make it a template in the
  future (things like =xyz= should be a variable instead of declared inline).
