<h2 as="h3">Notes:</h2>

- First paragraph's fancy lettering break the next paragraph if sufficient space isn't given.
  - a thematic break seems to work for sizes sm+
- List items are tiny because they dont have p styling
  - some list items get wrapped in p
  - perhaps list item styling needs to be updated

And the actual test:

## Introduction

Markdown is a markup language designed to be simple enough to let anyone write structured documents without the need of a visual editor

I **strongly** encourage you to change the source of the various parts to see what happens (the output will change as you type)

## Basic styles

With this markup you can obtain _simple emhpasis_ (usually rendered in italic text), **strong emphasis** (usually rendered in bold text), `source code` text (usually rendered in monospaced text), or ~~strikethrough~~ text (usually rendered with a line through text).

You may use also _this_ or **this** notation to emphatize text, and you can use all them _**`together`**_ (and you can mix `*` and `_` )

If you look at the source code you may note that
even
if
you
break
the
lines,
the text is kept together
in a single paragraph

Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, leading and trailing spaces are removed

You may force a line break with two spaces
or with a `\`\
at the end of the line
