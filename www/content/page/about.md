My name is **Khinshan Khan**.

To contact me, look at the footer of this website for your preferred method.

### About myself

Feel free to call me **Shan**. I'm a software engineer professionally and for fun. I'm passionate about just having a
good time, and if that helps someone else, it'd be pretty neat. Feel free to take a gander at some of my work
[here](/portfolio) and my resume [here](https://kkhan01.github.io/resume/resume.pdf).

As of late, I work at a cozy startup in Brooklyn. I do want to make it clear that although at times my thoughts may be
the same as my colleagues, unless stated explicitly, my writing _should not_ be considered _wholly representative_ of my
company.

### About site

To start with, the source code for this website is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/kkhan01/anchorage).

The stack is pnpm to manage dependencies, Gatsby for the frontend framework, Chakra UI for the styling, and Netlify to
host.
