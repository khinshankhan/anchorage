      <i>Sorry</i>, it seems you have stumbled into a page that doesn't exist (yet?). It's possible
      this page may come into existence later in the future... but for now, the way out is easy â€“
      you can try going back to the previous page or easily navigate over to the {` `}
      <InternalLink href="/">home page</InternalLink>.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      If you really feel like something is missing that should be here, feel free to {` `}
      <InternalLink href="/contact">contact me</InternalLink> ðŸ˜Š
    </Text>
