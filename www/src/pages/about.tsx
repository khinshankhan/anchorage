      Nice to meet you! I'm Khinshan, but feel free to call me Shan. I've put on many different hats
      and poked around a few different fields, but in the end I'm a software engineer professionally
      and for fun. I'm passionate about just having a good time, and if that helps someone else,
      it'd be pretty neat. Feel free to take a gander at some of my{` `}

      I do want to make it clear that although at times my thoughts may be the same as my
      colleagues, unless stated explicitly, my writing and opinions <i>should not</i> be considered
      {` `}
      <i>wholly nor partially representative</i> of my employer. In that vein, unless stated
      explicitly... employerâ€™s opinions are not mine.

      To start with, the source code for this website is available on GitHub{` `}
      <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/khinshankhan/anchorage">here</ExternalLink>. You're
      free to use the code in accordance to the MIT licensing I have on it. The content however is
      not under MIT licensing (tldr: cite me if you use my words, would be cool if you mentioned me
      somewhere when you use my code too ðŸ˜›).

      Iâ€™ve been discontent with my website, I mustâ€™ve changed it 10+ times now. After experimenting
      from vanilla to <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/sintaxi/harp">Harp</ExternalLink> to
      {` `}
      <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/Frozen-Flask/Frozen-Flask">Frozen Flask</ExternalLink>
      {` `}
      to <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</ExternalLink> etcetera
      etcetera, I've realized what I should use is what I feel most comfortable with and similar to
      what I use for work. Hopefully using modern technologies will make this full on rewrite the
      last rewrite for years on end. I've named it anchorage to keep me anchoredâ€¦ hopefully ðŸ˜³.

      I don't intend on making this a reusable template easy for anyone to use at the moment, but I
      {` `}
      <i>am</i> trying decouple personal information from the components. It's a long process and
      gets harder as tech debt piles up, but maybe one day this anchorage will be easy to fork and
      wind up.
